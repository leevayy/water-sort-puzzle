I've been bored to death at the plane and I had no internet access to install react, scss and all the stuff from npm, so i just used plain html, css and javascript. 
Turned out pretty decent in my opinion!

I used vscode live server to run the project, so i wasn't aware of CORS error occuring when you open index.html directly. To fix this I had to resort to node.js and http-server package ):
